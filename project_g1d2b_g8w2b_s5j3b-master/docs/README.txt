Hi Kimia, 
just a little reminder here that since Randy broke his hip, we're being excused from a few queries, counting them as 100%

That works. So, overall, you are now not required to do:

Nested Aggregation with Group By
Division
Aggregation with having queries
 
You are responsible for the rest of the project.

Please make a note of this in your project documentation that you turn in to make it easier for Kimia. Kimia, please also make a note of this.
